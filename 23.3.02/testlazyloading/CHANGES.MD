## Best practices changes (23.3.00 to 23.3.02)  
In 23.3.02 there are some minor modifications to the SDK and the archetypes used to generate View Component, View Actions, and Record Field View Components.  
These best practices are listed in our [documentation](https://docs.bmc.com/docs/innovationsuite/233/introduction-to-view-components-and-view-actions-1342726343.html?src=search).  
This section will list the changes from 23.3.00 to 23.3.02, as an example.  

> :memo:  
> Those modifications are NOT required. The 23.3.00 source code would continue to work.
