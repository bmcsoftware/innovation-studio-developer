<!-- This Platform component will automatically display the Components added during design time.
The canvas outlet allows components to be dragged and dropped
inside of it.
Since there are multiple outlets in this example, we need the Component to extend "ContainerDesignComponent".
The different methods will define:
    which components can be dragged and dropped,
    actions to apply when a component is actually dragged and dropped.
-->
