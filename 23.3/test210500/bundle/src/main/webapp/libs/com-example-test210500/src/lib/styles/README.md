The custom styles will be placed in this folder and need to be imported in the library main scss file, here "com-example-test210500.scss".  
For reference, this scss file is referred in the main "angular.json" file in the "styles" section and will be loaded automatically:  
```json
"styles": [
  {
    "input": "libs/com-example-test210500/src/lib/styles/com-example-test210500.scss",
    "bundleName": "com-example-test210500"
  }
]
```
